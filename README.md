# Experimental measurement of FPGA registers power consumption.

In this experiment, I compare power consumption of various FPGA devices' registers, using various consumer development boards. 

No attempt is made to explain the results, based on the differences in LE structure, manufacturing technology, process nanometers or whatever, just the numbers. Make of it what you will.

# Methodology

I compile the same VHDL program which generates as many flip-flop registers as possible for any given device, all forming up a chain. Every register in the chain passes its input to output at every tick, just like registers are supposed to. The chain is then fed with the half-rate pulse signal, which flips at every clock tick. Therefore, after the chain has flushed, every register will charge at tick N and discharge at tick N+1, releasing all the accumulated energy as fast as possible.

I then measure the power drained from the USB power supply, subtract the idle wattage measured in reset state of the running program and divide by the number of registers in the chain. The collected metric is therefore energy consumed (released) only by flipping registers, and the resulting numbers are in "microwatts per register".

The experiment is repeated three times with different clock frequencies, specifically 10, 25 and 100 megahertz, generated by whatever PLL machinery the device provides. One of the good signs is that the numbers scale linearly with the frequency, just as  you would expect.

This is how it conceptually looks like:
